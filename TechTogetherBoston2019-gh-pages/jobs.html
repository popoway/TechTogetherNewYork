The Toast system currently accepts orders from a number of different sources including our Android tablets (keyed by waitstaff), consumers (online orders) and partners (via our APIs). This code is executed multiple times by every single order that enters the system. We are dealing with problems of scale and representing billions of dollars in value to our customers. As we continue to grow, we expect the demands for orders and entry points into our system to increase rapidly. In order (pardon the pun) to meet these demands, we will need to build a system that is both increasingly extensible, robust, scalable and deliverable continuously. We need your help to improve our platform and add the next generation of features to this absolutely mission critical part of our product. <br></p>
